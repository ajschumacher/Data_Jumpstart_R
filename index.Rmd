## Why not use R?

* It's not Excel.
* It's not SAS/Stata/SPSS/etc.
* It's not C.
* Defaults to in-memory.

## What is R?

* A programming language designed for statistical computing and geographical representations of data.
* Comparable tools include: MATLAB, Python, SAS, Stata and SPSS
* Open source:
    * Free to download and use
    * Source Code is available
    * User Input

---

## Accessing R

* At NYU
    * DSS Workstations (5<sup>th</sup> floor of Bobst Library)
    * Most ITS Labs
* At Home
    * Free download/install: [cran.r-project.org](http://cran.r-project.org/)
    * Virtual Computing Lab (students only)
    * HPC Clusters (required account)

---

## Interactive CLI

* R's default graphical user interface (GUI) is an interactive command line interface (CLI).

![R Console](http://i.imgur.com/0zVAH17.png)

* Commands and expressions can be entered and evaluated line by line.
* R GUIs are also available - [sciviews.org/_rgui/](http://sciviews.org/_rgui/)

---

## Working Directories

* A working directory is the current file directory used reference importing and exporting files to/from R.
* Paths are used to reference locations outside of the current directory.
    * Folders are denoted by forward slashes: `/`
    * Moving up a folder is denoted by two periods: `..`
* Check the current working directory: `getwd()`
* Change the working directory: `setwd("<path>")`

## Writing R Programs

* R scripts should be written and saved instead of interactively using R's CLI.
* Some advantages to writing R scripts include:
    * Possibility to reuse code
    * Allows for editing of code
    * Easier to write and read complex expressions
* Comments can be added to a script with "`#`"
* Programs can be written in any text editor, including R's document editor, and called using the `source()` function.

---

## Using Functions

* Functions allow users to easily perform complex tasks using custom input and specifications.
* To call a function type its function name followed by the desired set argument(s) enclosed in parenthesis.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sqrt(4^2)
```
* Parenthesis are still required when a function takes no arguments.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```
* The most important function is likely `help()`.
* Take note of the default arguments for each function.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
sum(c(1,2,3,NA))
sum(c(1,2,3,NA),rm.na=TRUE)
```

---

## Packages

* Collections of user-created functions that are tested by and freely distributed to the R community.
* Users submit packages on a regular basis (4063 available as of 9/2012).
* Using a package requires a 3 steps:

1\. Install the package on your local machine (note: only needs to be done once per machine)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("<package name>")
```
2\. Load the install package (note: needs to be done each time R is opened)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(<package name>)
```
3\. Use the packages' objects

---

## Objects

* Objects are symbolic names that represent some form of information.
* In R there is no need to define an object's type upon declaration.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
var1 = 5
var2 = "a"
```
* R utilizes generic functions based upon an object's class. Use the `class()` function to check an object's class.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
class(var1)
```

---

## Vectors

* Vectors are basically one-dimensional arrays that hold one type, or class, of information.
* The `c()` function can be used to combine elements into a vector.
```{r,results='hide'}
v1 = c("a","b","c","d")
```
* Elements of a vector can be referenced via brackets and their corresponding index, which ranges from 1 to the number of elements in the vector.
```{r}
v1[2]
v1[c(4,1)]
```

---

## Workspace

* R's workspace contains all currently accessible objects.
* The workspace can be viewed with the `ls()` function.
* Objects can be deleted with the `rm()` function.
* the entire workspace can be saved to a .Rdata file with the `save.image()` function.
* An entire workspace can be loaded, and used later, with the `load()` function.

---

## Data Frames

* R's class for tabular datasets is data frame.
* The `data.frame()` function can be used convert a set of vectors of equal length, but potentially different classes, into a data fram.
* Data frame elements can be referenced using brackets and indices, like so: `<dataframe>[<row>,<column>]`.
* Columns also have names that can be referenced vis "$".
```{r, eval=FALSE}
names(data)
data$score
```
* Since one column is a vector, elements of a column can still be referenced with brackets and an index.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
data$score[2]
```

---

## Importing Datasets

* Datasets of virtually any format can be imported into R, however some formats may require packages.
* Raw data can be read in using functions like `read.csv()`, `read.table()` or `scan()`, and the "foreign" package offers a number of functions that can import datasets from other statistically packages, including SPSS, SAS, and Stata.
* Remember that calling a function does not automatically save the result to an object, so make sure to save the imported dataset to specified object.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
data = read.csv(file="<rtut.csv>")
```

---

## Editing Data

* Raw data can manually be edited by referencing the elements you would like to change and their desired new value(s).
```{r, eval=FALSE}
data$id[1] = -99
```
* The `edit()` function can also be used to edit data in a spreadsheet-like fashion.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
data = edit(data)
```
* Variables may also need to be edited.
    * Check the class of each variable via `str()` or `class()`.
    * Use functions to update classes, such as `as.factor()`.

---

## Recoding & Computing Variables

* Variables can be recoded in a number of ways, particularly the `recode()` function in the "car" package.
* Recoded variables can either be new or replace already existing variables depending on the object that is stored in.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
data$health2 = recode(data$health2, "1=5;2=4;3=3;4=2;5=1")
data$health2_R = recode(data$health2, "1=5;2=4;3=3;4=2;5=1")
```
* Variables can be created referencing a new variable name in a data frame.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
<dataframe>$<new name> = <vector of desired information>
data$health = mean(data[,c(“health1”, “health2”, … , “health6”)])
```

---

## Creating Subsets

* Subsets may be created by manually referencing elements.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
sub1 <- data[2:5,c("age","health")]
```
* The `which()` function can also be used to select element indices based upon a conditional statement.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
sub2 <- data[which(data$age > 40),c("age","health")]
```
* The `subset()` function can also be used and is likely the best choice for more complex subsets.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
sub3 <- subset(data, age > 40, select=c("age","health"))
```

---

## Descriptive Statistics & Graphics

* R offers a great deal of descriptive statistics and graphics applications via base functions and in numerous packages.
* Some commonly used functions include:
    * Descriptives: `summary()`, `table()`, `mean()`, and `sd()`
    * Graphics: `plot()`, `boxplot()` and `barplot()`
* Some commonly used graphics packages include "ggplot2" and "lattice".

---

## Statistical Analysis

* R offers functions to conduct the vast majority of commonly used statistical procedures and the ability to write your own.
* Packages frequently offer improvements upon existing procedures or new functions entirely.
* Commonly used statistical function include:
    * `cor()` - Correlations
    * `t.test()` - T-Tests
    * `aov()` - ANOVA
    * `lm()` - Linear Regression
    * `glm()` - Generalized Linear Models
